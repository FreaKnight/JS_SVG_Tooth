# JS_SVG_Tooth

A little project to familiarise my self with javascript canvas api.
Intent of this is to draw a patient’s tooth chart then stylizing the teeth to show what was done to them. The user will then be able to click on the tooth to bring up detailed information on the procedure.
This is at proof of concept stage. I am thinking of taking the tooth path information to the back end and request the paths based of the tooth chart info that will also be served up from the back end.
I’ll am most probably utilize event bubbling to get the coordinates of where the user clicked to get the tooth information.
